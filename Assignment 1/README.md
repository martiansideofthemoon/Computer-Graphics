To compile type "make."

The provided makefile is very rudimentary. You can improve it if you want.

All class must be added to mydraw_class.hpp and mydraw_class.cpp.

All opengl and glut code goes in mydraw.cpp, except that used in the canvas draw method which will be a part of the canvas_t class implementation.
